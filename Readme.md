# Project Whale Identification

### Intro

During my scholar years (Preparatory classes to Great Schools/CPGE), we had to complete a research and experimentation work.

The imposed theme that year was the **Ocean**, so I set to complete a Kaggle challenge to identify humpback whales with images of theirs tails using Deep Learning methods (See https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/humpback-whale-identification/overview).

But due to the COVID pandemic and subsequent lockdowns, I wasn't able to complete the project. Since then, I complete Engineering School and have now a more complete formation in the domain of Deep Learning and Computer Vision, so I want to give this project another try.

Since the challenge is over for quite some time, we already have performance results to compare.

Also, I am using this project in particular because my PC has not changed configuration since then so I know this project is doable on my limited Accelerated GPU (a good'ld 2017 GTX 1060 with 6Go of VRAM).

My hardware is :
 - CPU : Intel i5-7500 3.4 GHz
 - GPU : GTX 1060 6Go
 - RAM : 2x DDR4 4 Go 2400 MHz CAS 17 and 2x DDR4 8Go 3200 MHz CAS 16
